# AppetiserCodeChallenge
This app was created as part of the Coding Challenge for Appetiser.

## Overview
This app demonstrates a simple Master/Detail Flow. It fetches data from the Itunes search API with the query parameters:
term, country, and media. The values for these query parameters have been hardcoded, with the term = "star", country = "au", and media = "movie".

The app follows the MVVM software architectural pattern.
